## TItanic_Survival Prediction - Kaggle 

This repository is R Studio for Kaggle Dataset, https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

* The RMS Titanic was not only the largest ship at that time but also the largest man-made moving object in the world. It was the most deathful/fatal maritime disaster with over 1500 casualties. It is almost %68 of the total passengers and crew. There are several facts about the Titanic disaster. Such as;

   - An insufficient number of boats (20 out of 64 boats) that cause this huge number of deaths,
   - Most of the survivors being woman and children,
   - The most expensive first-class suites priced up to £870 in peak season (£79,000 today) according to Wikipedia.
   - Titanic disaster is one of the most important catastrophes that data examination may provide details about survived and non-survived passenger characteristics. Thus, it is crucial to understand survivor profiles in order to save other lives.

* The project have 4 main topics:
   
1. Data Exploration - To understand and get detailed information about dependent variable and other parameters.
2. Feature Engineering - To create new parameters that can increased accuracy and help to make better prediction.
3. Data Analysis - To prepeare and fit the parameters for building model
4. Model Building - To build different models and comparing their accuracy for making prediction with the best of.
